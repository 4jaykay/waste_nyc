# waste_nyc

This is some of the data I used for [my project](https://juliekerisel.wixsite.com/jkrsl/nyc-waste) on waste and waste diversion in NYC from 2019 and 2021. 

The .xlsx file includes: 
 * a data dictionary, 
 * the original DSNY tonnage data, 
 * normalized DSNY data (waste in lbs per 1,000 people)
 * income and population data 
 * percent change in waste 
 * K-means cluster groups for diversion rates and median income 
 * K-means cluster groups for refuse waste and median income 

The jupyter notebook is the code I used to visualize the K-means cluser analyses in scatterplots.
